                    contact you sometime within the next week when they are ready. Please give them 
                    the opportunity to contact you first.  This will be to talk to you further, to get 
                    to know you better and to discuss more detail about potential projects.

                    another student for the project.  So, please reply promptly to each host and do not 
                    wait in case another host contacts you.  Delaying a reply may mean you miss that 
                    opportunity (as well as being impolite) and the other host may not contact you.

                    So, please check your email regularly - at least daily - and reply promptly to any communications.  
                    Remember that the hosts are volunteering their time and resources to these projects and have 
                    busy jobs, so please respect that by getting back to them promptly when they make contact.
